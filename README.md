This template is intended to setup a repository to facilitate the collaborative development of terraform modules while still ensuring the integrity of the module code to the consuming applications & teams.  

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to the template, which is also the recommended process to start to allow others to contribute to your Teraform module.  You are encouraged to mature your repository, but please try to keep it simple (and always provide instructions) how others can contribute.

We purposefully put most of the information for repo/module maintainers in a separate file [module-maintainer-guidelines.md](module-maintainer-guidelines.md) in order to all them to use this main readme to provide information to the consumers of their Terraform module.
